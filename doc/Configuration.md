## Cookie behaviours
There are 5 cookie denial behaviours available to choose from. Although
they will not get saved to the disk as they woul be if **CookieBox**
wasn't active, some of the behaviours also house special treatments.

*	üö´ `deny`

	The cookie is denied and, according to the configuration options,
	**CookieBox** will either throw an
	[*exception*](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw),
	[*log an error*](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Console/error)
	to the error stream or do nothing at all.

*	üöÆ `drop`

	The cookie will simply be dropped.

*	‚ùì `blank`

	The cookie *will* be saved, although the value will be blank.
	
	The full cookie will be saved in the
	[pseudo storage](#pseudo-storage) though.

*	üëª `ghost`

	The cookie will only be saved in the
	[pseudo storage](#pseudo-storage). 

*	a custom function

## Pseudo storage
The pseudo storage is **CookieBox**'s way to fake set cookies, when
they actually have not been written to the disk.

Queries to `document.cookie` will return a list that contains the fake
cookies with their values.
